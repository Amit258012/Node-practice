# How to Run a Node.js File Locally

1. **Install Node.js**: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Node.js on your computer. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Open a Terminal**: Navigate to the directory containing your Node.js file using a terminal or command prompt. You can do this with the `cd` command. For example, if your file is in a directory called `my-project`, you would type `cd my-project`.

3. **Run the File**: Once you're in the correct directory, you can run your Node.js file with the `node` command followed by the name of your file. For example, if your file is called `app.js`, you would type `node app.js`.

And that's it! Your Node.js file should now be running locally on your computer.
